# DNS for Kimmo Ahokas #

This repository contains DNS records for my personal domains. It uses [DNSControl](https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/) to manage DNS records in multiple different providers. GitHub automations are used to verify the validity of records and to push changes automatically to production.
